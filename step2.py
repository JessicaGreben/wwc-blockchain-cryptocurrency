# Task: Implement a `Blockchain` class.

# A Blockchain should have the following attributes:
# - a data structure to store blocks 
#     - along with a single genesis block

# A genesis block is the first block of a block chain. The genesis block is typically hardcoded into the blockchain.

# A Blockchain should be able to perform the following functions:
# - create a new block and add it to the blocks attribute
# - get the most recent block in from the blocks attribute
